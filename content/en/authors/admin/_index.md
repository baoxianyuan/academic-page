👋 Hello! I'm Shuang Song, a postdoctoral researcher at Beijing Normal University and Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology.
My research primarily uses water as a link and modeling as an approach to studying the interaction between human society and the landscape and environment as an intertwined social-ecological system (SES). Based on my interdisciplinary background in history and geography, I construct agent-based models (ABMs) for water-related issues, simulating agents' interaction within given institutional and environmental settings across different temporal (e.g., centuries and millennia) and spatial scales (regional and global). I also examine how institutions can influence this interaction by changing human society's adaptation and resilience to environmental changes, thereby contributing to sustainable development.

Beyond research, I'm an adept Python developer and led open-source projects [`ABSESpy`](https://github.com/ABSESpy/ABSESpy), a ABM package for real-world SES simulation; and [`PaperBell`](https://github.com/SongshGeo/Obsidian-PaperBell), a note taking system for academic research based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
