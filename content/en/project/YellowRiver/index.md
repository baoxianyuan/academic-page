title: Social-ecological system analysis of the Yellow River Basin
summary: China's Yellow River Basin (YRB) is one of the most anthropogenically altered large river basins worldwide. Therefore, coupling human and natural system studies is crucial to support its sustainability. This project aims at using a social-ecological system framework to deepen our understanding of this complex system.

## Background

<!-- 在人类活动的强烈影响下，全球资源环境面临前所未有的压力，地球进入“人类世”的新纪元（Crutzen and Stoermer, 2019）。深入理解现代环境变化机理、准确预测未来变化趋势是地球系统科学研究的前沿领域（Steffen et al., 2020）。这就需要发展系统整体的方法，耦合自然与人文过程，探讨变化环境下人地系统耦合机制。人地系统是自然地理环境与人类社会经济所构成相互作用、相互影响的复杂巨系统，揭示其要素动态演化、解析过程耦合机制、明晰优化调控途径，可为区域可持续发展提供坚实的理论基础（吴传钧，1991；陆大道，2002；傅伯杰，2017）。黄河流域在三千多年来悠久的历史开发和近现代的高强度经济活动影响下，人类活动与资源环境间的要素关系、上中下游区域之间的空间联系不断变化。作为具有明确边界范围内“水-土-气-生-人”要素相互作用的完整单元，流域是环境变化背景下人地系统研究的理想场所（程国栋和李新，2015）。阐明黄河流域人地系统耦合机理，构建耦合模型探求流域人地系统优化调控路径，支撑流域可持续发展，将有助于推动我国跻身地球系统科学研究的国际前沿。

国内外人地系统研究近年来在以人-水系统理论、水-粮食-能源关联为主的流域人地系统耦合机制研究中取得系列进展，流域人地系统耦合模型与大数据平台的发展成为人地系统耦合方法学研究的重要发展方向，基于人地系统耦合机理的流域综合治理和优化受到高度关注。当前，黄河流域保护和发展需要强调系统性、整体性、协同性的解决思路，针对以下研究挑战实现重点突破，包括：流域人水系统中社会-水文-生态要素互馈机理与弹性特征缺乏定量表达，流域水-粮食-能源系统的动态演变与外部效应的关联未能整体刻画，人地系统模型中自然生态与社会经济过程的数据匹配和互馈机制定量刻画能力不足，流域水安全、生态安全协同保障下的可持续发展路径亟待系统研判等。抓住当前黄河流域生态保护和高质量发展的国家战略机遇，揭示黄河流域人地系统耦合机理与优化调控机制，不仅将从系统性、整体性、协同性为黄河流域生态保护与可持续发展提供科学依据，也将通过流域集成研究推动我国地球系统科学的发展。 -->

The global environment is under unprecedented pressure due to the strong influence of human activities, and the Earth is entering a new era of the Anthropocene. Understanding the mechanisms of modern environmental change and predicting future trends are at the forefront of Earth system science research. This requires developing a holistic systems approach, coupling natural and human processes and exploring the mechanisms of human-earth system coupling in changing environments. The human-terrestrial system is a complex giant in which the natural geographical environment and human socio-economy interact and feedback. Revealing the evolution of its dynamic, resolving the coupling mechanism of processes, and clarifying the optimal regulation pathways can provide a solid theoretical foundation for regional sustainable development. 

The Yellow River Basin (YRB) has been influenced by more than 3,000 years of historical development and modern high-intensity economic activities; the spatial linkages between human activities and the resources and environment, and the region's upper, middle, and lower reaches, are still changing. The river basin is ideal for studying human-water systems in environmental change. Therefore, it is informative to elucidate the mechanism of socio-hydrological system coupling in the YRB, providing fundamental inspiration for water sustainable management worldwide, and promoting the development of earth system science in China through integrated research in the basin.

## Goals & Scientific questions
<!-- 
(1) 黄河流域人水关系演变与稳态识别

针对社会-生态用水、缺水、分水以及输沙等方面建立表征人水关系变化的指标和方法，解析千年、百年、十年尺度黄河流域人水关系的发展演变过程；以人水关系变化为枢纽，结合关键突变点识别，揭示黄河流域人水关系的稳态类型、特征与阈值，阐明历史和当代黄河流域人水关系发展演变特征与驱动机制。

(2) 黄河流域人-水关系互馈机制

量化社会-水文系统的关键变量，识别人-水主要互馈过程并量化正负反馈循环。分析社会要素（如经济发展、管理决策、社会感知等）通过反馈循环对流域社会-生态过程（如流域生态健康、洪旱风险适应、水沙调控等）的影响，揭示人-水相互作用及其协同进化机制；通过选择关键变量，刻画主要互馈过程，发展人水关系互馈机理和动态模型。

(3) 黄河流域社会-水文-生态系统动态及其弹性

综合分析黄河流域社会-生态-水文系统动态演化特征，建立表征流域对气候变化和人类活动响应的弹性指标体系；评估流域社会-生态-水文系统弹性时空格局并分析水对流域弹性的影响及作用方式、关键过程、临界阈值，探寻弹性提升途径。 -->

(1) **Identifying the evolution of the human-water relationship and its regimes in the YRB**
To establish indicators and methods for characterising changes in human-water relations regarding socio-ecological water use, water scarcity, water diversion and sand transport, and to analyse the development and evolution of human-water relations in the Yellow River basin at millennial, centennial and decennial scales. 

(2) **Feedback and its mechanism of the socio-hydrological system in the YRB**
Quantify the critical variables of the socio-hydrological system, identify the main human-water feedback and quantify the positive and negative feedback loops. Analyse the impact of social factors (e.g. economic development, management decisions, social perceptions, etc.) on socio-ecological processes in the basin (e.g. ecological health of the bay, flood and drought risk adaptation, water and sand regulation, etc.) through feedback loops to reveal human-water interactions and their synergistic evolutionary mechanisms.

(3) **Dynamic of coupled human and hydrology system and its resilience in the YRB**
A comprehensive analysis of the dynamic evolution of the socio-ecological-hydrological system of the Yellow River basin and the establishment of a system of resilience indicators to characterise the basin's response to climate change and human activities.

**Specifically, I focus on the below scientific questions:** 
- What are the main drivers of the evolution of the human-water relationship in the YRB?
- How social elements, especially the variables of collective behaviour, influences the processes of the socio-hydrological system, taking the YRB as an informative example. 
- In addition to engineering, how to build and improve the resilience of the social-hydrological system in the YRB through "soft" solutions from the social aspect.
