abstract: ABSESpy is a novel agent-based modeling (ABM) framework that facilitates socio-ecological systems (SES) research. It serves as an extension package of Mesa, the most popular ABM framework, and further enhances agents’ interactions with other components, especially grid-like spaces. With a configuration file for managing parameters and an improved data Input/Output system, ABSESpy’s modularity and low-coupling design enable elegant maintenance of large modeling projects. In addition, ABSESpy includes a schedule that aligns models’ tick with the calendar time. These innovations position ABSESpy as a valuable tool in fostering more ABMs for real-world SES issues. Its ultimate aim is to become the go-to choice for ABM when working with a human-involved changing world.
