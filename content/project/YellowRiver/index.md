title: Coordination mechanism and regulation of the water-sediment-economic system in the Yellow River Basin
summary: China's Yellow River Basin (YRB) is one of the most anthropogenically altered large river basins worldwide. Therefore, coupling human and natural system studies is crucial to support its sustainability. This project aims at using a social-ecological system framework to deepen our understanding of this complex system.

## Background

The global environment is under unprecedented pressure due to the strong influence of human activities, and the Earth is entering a new era of the Anthropocene. Understanding the mechanisms of modern environmental change and predicting future trends are at the forefront of Earth system science research. This requires developing a holistic systems approach, coupling natural and human processes and exploring the mechanisms of human-earth system coupling in changing environments. The human-terrestrial system is a complex giant in which the natural geographical environment and human socio-economy interact and feedback. Revealing the evolution of its dynamic, resolving the coupling mechanism of processes, and clarifying the optimal regulation pathways can provide a solid theoretical foundation for regional sustainable development.

The Yellow River Basin (YRB) has been influenced by more than 3,000 years of historical development and modern high-intensity economic activities; the spatial linkages between human activities and the resources and environment, and the regionâ€™s upper, middle, and lower reaches, are still changing. The river basin is ideal for studying human-water systems in environmental change. Therefore, it is informative to elucidate the mechanism of socio-hydrological system coupling in the YRB, providing fundamental inspiration for water sustainable management worldwide, and promoting the development of earth system science in China through integrated research in the basin.
