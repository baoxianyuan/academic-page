## Skills used in My Papers

### Complex Network Analysis (ANA)
In the [Decreased Virtual Water Outflows from the Yellow River Basin Are Increasingly Critical to China](/publication/paper4/), I used the popular Python package `Networkx` to apply CNA. 

### Agent-based modelling (ABM)
I'm working on an open-source package 「**coupling human and natural systems in ABM**」(CHNS_Agents). This package provides a framework for building coupled human and natural systems. More information can be found in my project: [Complex system modelling of human-water relationships](/project/project2/).

### Causal inference
In the paper [[Item Water Allocation Institution]], I applied 「[Differenced Synthetic Control](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190159)」by Python to analyze institutional shifts' net effect on water use. 

### Time series analysis
Analyzing time-series data are available in a lot of my papers since evolution is of my top concerns: 
- [Decoupling of SDGs followed by re-coupling as sustainable development progresses.pdf](/recent-publications/paper3/)
- [Decreased Virtual Water Outflows from the Yellow River Basin Are Increasingly Critical to China](/publication/paper4/)
- [Sediment Transport under Increasing Anthropogenic Stress_Regime Shifts within the Yellow River, China](/publication/paper10/)
- [Improving Representation of Collective Memory in Socio-hydrological Models and New Insights into Flood Risk Management](/publication/paper8/)

### Data visualization
I'm also a big fan of [data viz]([[Soft skills_Visualization]]) in Python; here are some of my workpieces:

## Skills used in projects for Fun

### Command Line Tool: Mksci
The twist is a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research. He also developed [an open-source framework package, "mksci"](#), for scholars to manage their multi-sources datasets, approaches, outputs, and manuscript versions easier. 

### Django Project: Dream Bottle
Open-source project for fun. Codes are accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/SongshGeo/dream_bottle)

## Courses
- 2020: I finished the ["Data scientist in Python"](https://app.dataquest.io/learning-path) path course on Dataquest.
- 2021: I finished ["Machine Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course/home/welcome) on Coursera, provided by Andrew Ng from the Stanford Online team.
