## Data viz example dataset
I collected hundreds of inspiring data viz pieces, which gave me a lot of ideas when drawing figures in my research. 
I also noted and labelled them for filtering for a specific type of data viz. This project will be open-source after personal collections reach 1000!

## Small Data Viz project for fun: Traditional Chinese Colors

I developed an open-source package, which can automatically suggest a Chinese Traditional colour palette to users; more information is accessible in this [Repository](https://github.com/SongshGeo/Chinese-Traditional-Colors).
